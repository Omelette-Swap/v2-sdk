Omchain Labs Ltd. is not the original developer of the OmeletteSwap project, nor was involved in its token sale, or fundraising activities.

The smart contracts for OmeletteSwap were deployed by a third-party team that is no longer maintaining the project. In 2024, Omchain Labs was given admin access to the platform to ensure operational continuity, particularly because the application was running on the Omchain blockchain.

We have not received any income, commission, or token allocation related to OmeletteSwap. We did not create, or distribute the token.

This platform is autonomous and operates without custodial control. Any users accessing OmeletteSwap do so at their own risk.

This statement is issued for transparency and to clarify that we are not legally or financially responsible for past or future activities associated with OmeletteSwap.
